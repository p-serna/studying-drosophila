# Studying Drosophila Melanogaster dataset
## About
This is a project under construction for studying [Drosophila Melanogaster dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/drosophila-melanogaster-genome). The main idea is to use n-grams and machine learning techniques to identify features and understand it better. My first contact with biopython is heavily inspired by [this post](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/getting-started-with-biopython) in Kaggle.


## Getting started
