# Studying Drosophila Melanogaster dataset
## About
This is a project under construction for studying [Drosophila Melanogaster dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/drosophila-melanogaster-genome). The main idea is to use k-mers and machine learning techniques to identify features and gain a deeper insight about the dataset. My first contact with biopython is heavily inspired by [this post](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/getting-started-with-biopython) in Kaggle.


## Getting started

For the moment, everything is the [jupyter notebooks](Drosophila.ipynb)

## Requirements
- biopython
- numpy
- scipy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
